        <li>warm water</li>
        <li>whole milk</li>
        <li>egg yolks</li>
        <li>white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>melted butter + melted butter for bruising the mallorca</li>
        <li>bread flour (all purpose will work too)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl combine yeast and warm water. Let the yeast proof for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>To the yeast mixture add milk, egg yolks, sugar, melted butter and whisk together until consistent.</li>
        <li>
            In another large bowl, mix together the bread flour and salt. Slowly start incorporating the flour, one cup at a 
            time, mixture into the bowl with the wet ingredients. Mix with a wooden spoon until a dough forms, adding more 
            flour if itâ€™s too sticky.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for a few minutes before transferring to a clean, lightly 
            greased bowl with room for the dough to rise.
        </li>
        <li>Cover with a towel and let rise for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>
            Transfer the dough to a flour dusted surface again and split in half, then split each half into thirds, then in 
            half again to make 12 even sized balls.
        </li>
        <li>Roll the balls out into long strips (about a foot in length) then coil into a circle.</li>
        <li>
            Transfer the mallorca rolls to the parchment lined pans, leaving room for them to rise, and brush with melted 
            butter. Cover again with a clean kitchen towel and allow the rolls to rise for 45 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350. Bake sweet rolls for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown on the outside.</li>
        <li>Dust with powdered sugar and enjoy!</li>
