    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Empanadillas are a lovely blend of buttery, flaky pie dough stuffed with the most delicious ground beef seasoned with 
        traditional Puerto Rican spices, tomato, sofrito and olives. These savory hand pies are then lightly fried until 
        golden brown and crisp around the edges.</p>
    <p>Many Puerto Rican recipes use the classic Picadillo filling we’re making today, like these Alcapurrias I’m sure you’ll 
        love if you enjoy these Empanadillas.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the dough (skip to making the picadillo filling if using store-bought dough.)</strong> Start by 
            combining all ingredients in a bowl and mixing well until a ball begins to form.
        </li>
        <li>Knead on a flour dusted surface until no longer sticky and chill for 30 minutes while you make the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Picadillo filling.</strong> Start with oil, onions, and peppers in a pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>
            Once onions become translucent, add sofrito and sauté another minute before adding ground beef. Break the ground 
            beef into smaller pieces as it cooks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add sazon, adobo, bay leaves, tomato sauce, olives, and water. Bring it to a boil before simmering with a lid 
            partially on, for 10 minutes or until the beef is fully cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prep the dough.</strong> Dust a clean surface with flour and roll dough out to about ¼ inch thickness and 
            cut out circular discs using a large cookie cutter or small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon picadillo over half of each disc, fold the empty dough over top and pinch together with a fork. </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fry.</strong> Heat oil to around 350 degrees before frying empanadas on each side for 3-4 minutes or 
            until golden brown and crispy on the edges. Enjoy!
